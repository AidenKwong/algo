      <h2>What is data structure?</h2>
      <p>
        In computer science, a data structure is a data organization,
        management, and storage format that enables efficient access and
        modification. More precisely, a data structure is a collection of data
        values, the relationships among them, and the functions or operations
        that can be applied to the data, i.e., it is an algebraic structure
        about data.
      </p>
      <h2>What is algorithm?</h2>
      <p>
        In mathematics and computer science, an algorithm is a finite sequence
        of well-defined instructions, typically used to solve a class of
        specific problems or to perform a computation. Algorithms are used as
        specifications for performing calculations and data processing. By
        making use of artificial intelligence, algorithms can perform automated
        deductions (referred to as automated reasoning) and use mathematical and
        logical tests to divert the code through various routes (referred to as
        automated decision-making). Using human characteristics as descriptors
        of machines in metaphorical ways was already practiced by Alan Turing
        with terms such as "memory", "search" and "stimulus".
